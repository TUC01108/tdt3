Trying out a gobal alias change in git to combine add and commit-
git config --global alias.ac "!f() { git add . && git commit -m \"$@\"; }; f"
now i just type-
git ac "message"
I think this can be better when adding all.
ooo and this one too-
alias gac='git add . && git commit -m'
to be used like
gac "message"
that one was just for shell not for windows. so git ac "message" is best we can do.

Pasting this from private repo- 
I'm not sure if creating a new branch or a new file altogether is what I actually want so just jumping in with a new branch.
	This is first update in almost 2 years. Tech updates for AI agentic courses.
	Need to get this workflow for journaling down as a first step so was looking for atom, but its no longer maintained.
	Then it said maybe github desktop with notepad++ could work and then it said git command line with notepad++ is even better.
	So lets see. Maybe just editing direct in here could be quickest fix for now, but I'll give this a few minutes.
	So first is to download git. which I need to do anyways.
Okay so downloading git from here- https://git-scm.com/install/
Downloaded 2/52/0 arm 64 to C:\Program Files\Git
It is crazy how just setting up GIT has so many prompts. Im using Claude Sonnet 4 through playground to navigate.
One thing that stands out is credental helper and all these options that probably make life easier but reduce privacy.
Github being maintained by Microsoft who owns GitHub. Why do we trust these companies with our keys?
Anyways I choose convenience for now. Ignorance is bliss.
Installing now.
Done.
Launched gitbash... I think
actually just reopened cmd terminal with adm access and entered this.
git config --global core.editor "notepad++.exe -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"
navigated to my project folder notes00
Ok so i setup git inside my desktop notes00 folder and connected to this repo. now to get this file onto local so I dont
have to edit from inside github.
</p>
<p>
Okay now I am editing from inside notepad++. WAHOO.
Pretty cool.
I had to update the git config --global user.email and user.name and then I couldnt push because I didnt pull
yet so I tried git pull but it had no tracking information for the current branch so I did
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main
and then git pull worked and then git push origin main worked.
and now I will test pushing from here to repo.
Checking command terminal with git status.
See a modified Jan26 file.
git add . or git add Jan26
git commit -m "from repo to local to repo"
git push origin main.
I'm going to paste what Claude showed me for git go tos-
####
Basic Workflow:
1. Navigate to your project folder:

bash
cd path/to/your/project
2. Initialize Git (if new project):

bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
3. Daily workflow:

bash
# Edit files in Notepad++, save them

# Check what changed
git status

# See specific changes
git diff filename.txt

# Stage files for commit
git add filename.txt
# or stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
Useful Git Commands:
bash
# Check current status
git status

# View commit history
git log --oneline

# Pull latest changes
git pull

# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b new-feature

# Switch branches
git checkout main

# See what files are tracked
git ls-files
####

So it took a bit of setup time but I'm happy with this. Now lets do a bit more of the course. I will update
here or in the Course1notes file.
Okay that's good for now. Cheers.
