Pasting this from private repo- 
I'm not sure if creating a new branch or a new file altogether is what I actually want so just jumping in with a new branch.
	This is first update in almost 2 years. Tech updates for AI agentic courses.
	Need to get this workflow for journaling down as a first step so was looking for atom, but its no longer maintained.
	Then it said maybe github desktop with notepad++ could work and then it said git command line with notepad++ is even better.
	So lets see. Maybe just editing direct in here could be quickest fix for now, but I'll give this a few minutes.
	So first is to download git. which I need to do anyways.
Okay so downloading git from here- https://git-scm.com/install/
Downloaded 2/52/0 arm 64 to C:\Program Files\Git
It is crazy how just setting up GIT has so many prompts. Im using Claude Sonnet 4 through playground to navigate.
One thing that stands out is credental helper and all these options that probably make life easier but reduce privacy.
Github being maintained by Microsoft who owns GitHub. Why do we trust these companies with our keys?
Anyways I choose convenience for now. Ignorance is bliss.
Installing now.
Done.
Launched gitbash... I think
actually just reopened cmd terminal with adm access and entered this.
git config --global core.editor "notepad++.exe -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"
navigated to my project folder notes00
