Pasting this from private repo- 
I'm not sure if creating a new branch or a new file altogether is what I actually want so just jumping in with a new branch.
	This is first update in almost 2 years. Tech updates for AI agentic courses.
	Need to get this workflow for journaling down as a first step so was looking for atom, but its no longer maintained.
	Then it said maybe github desktop with notepad++ could work and then it said git command line with notepad++ is even better.
	So lets see. Maybe just editing direct in here could be quickest fix for now, but I'll give this a few minutes.
	So first is to download git. which I need to do anyways.
